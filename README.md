# Monty_Hall_Simulation
This project simulates the Monty Hall problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). It will run a specified number of times and display how many times the strategy of staying with your door or picking a new door leads to a win in this probability puzzle. 

To run from command line from the Monty_Hall_Simulation directory run "python -m simulation.run 10000 3 1" for example.
