# Monty_Hall_Simulation
This was developed and tested with Python 3.8.2

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). It will run a specified number of times and display how many times the strategy of staying with your door or picking a new door leads to a win in this probability puzzle. 

To run from command line from the Monty_Hall_Simulation directory run "python -m simulation.run" for example.

You can also specify the sample size, number of doors and openings.
"python -m simulation.run 1000 3 1" will run 1000 samples with 3 doors and one door being opened.
